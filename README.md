### :book: The User Manuals...
There are multiple manuals, which are more or less interconnected, involved in the whole project.

- The [Movie File Merger User Manual][], which concentrates on the program technical aspects of handling MFM.  It is a GitBook and on [GitHub][GitHub MFM UM].
- [How to Organize Videos on Your Hard Disks][] explains some of my ideas about handling collections and includes a few brief description of some useful programs.  It is also a GitBook and on [GitHub][GitHub HtOVoYHD].
